    "Conway's Game of Life is a \"no-player never-ending game\" played on board of squares.  It was invented by [John Conway](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/23/john-horton-conway-the-most-charismatic-mathematician-in-the-world) in 1968, out of a desire to create a demonstration of how simple rules might lead to complex behavior, much like how relatively simple physical processes generated all of earth's complicated biodiversity, at least in microcosmic sense.  For our purposes, it will yield a fun and interesting starting point for practicing some useful python skills prior to diving into some more mathematical topics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the game are simple, and we'll develop them sequentially.  We begin by defining a rectangular board of cells, each of which can be either \"alive\" or \"dead\".  A good size to begin with is 10x10.  The best way to store this board is as a numpy array.  **Import numpy and create the board, with all positions initially set to \"dead\" (or false, as the case may be).**"

You can use numpy's array indexing for this, e.g. if you wanted to initialize a 2x2 square with corner at position i=2,j=2, you could set S[2:4,2:4]=True, if S is the name of your board."

    "While this is interesting, the real fascinating dynamics of Conway's Game of Life emerge when the update_board function is iterated from time $t=0$ to $t=T$.  Write a for loop that performs this iteration and saves the output at each step to a list.  One common gotcha is that if you append your state array to a list, you may end up with $T$ references to the same array, which of course is being updated.  This is not what you want.  Be sure you save the board state at time $t$ by using a function such as np.copy prior to appending it.  Try running the code for 20 steps.  "
